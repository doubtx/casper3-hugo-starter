## Introduction

Yes, dogs **can eat pumpkin**. In fact, pumpkin is a **superfood**. It is not just safe for dogs â€“ it is also **healthy** and loaded with unique **nutrients** while being **low in calories**. Plus, dogs enjoy the pumpkin **flavor** and **texture**.

However, keep in mind that dogs are carnivores and need meat-based protein as the main nutrient. In practical terms, pumpkin is an excellent (healthy and tasty) **addition** to the otherwise **complete** and **balanced canine diet**.
